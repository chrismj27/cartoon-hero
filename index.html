      <!-- Characteristics -->
      <!-- <h2>Fifi's Characteristics</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          She is a purple skunk with a white torso and a white stripe down her
          back and tail.
        </li>
        <li>Fifi speaks with a very strong French accent.</li>
        <li>She is known to persue potential boyfriends very persistently.</li>
        <li>
          She has a long fluffy tail which she uses to deliver her powerful
          skunkly essence.
        </li>
        <li>
          She has wavy lavender hair that curls down over her forehed and she
          usually has a pink hair bow behind one of her ears.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fifi usually goes &OpenCurlyQuote;au naturel&CloseCurlyQuote; but she
          wears a dress in a few episodes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fifi seems to live in a junkyard, where she takes shelter in the back
          seat of a broken down car. And apparently, she has land line phone
          service there!
        </li>
        <li>
          In <i>Tiny Toon Adventures</i> Magazine (which is essentially the TTA
          comic book) Fifi writes an advice column where she answers letters
          from both fictional and actual fans about love and relationships.
        </li>
